Things to fix:
	-Human player:
		should listen to the mouse in order to determine if move is made, if they hit undo or if they hit quit
		should also return w, u, q, n, or t
	-Computer player:
		should just have ability to make a move or undo their previous move 
			make move should return w if they win, n for keep going, t for tie
	-Game Screen:
		- undo button
		-quit button
		-winning/tie pop up -> hit continue and you go back to start screen
